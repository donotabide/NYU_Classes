Notes:

We gave AbstractZoombinis.java to the class for Hw2.
	They are to write Zoombinis.java to extend this "abstract" class.

AbstractZoombinis2.java  and Zoombinis2.java
	is an alternative design (with static variables)
	But we still need an instance of Zoombinis2 to get
	to the methods!

	REASON: static methods are not allowed to be abstract!

		Solution?  Provided NON-ABSTRACT static methods
		(so, you need to return a value in an default implementation)
		That is our third design...

AbstractZoombinis3.java  and Zoombinis3.java
	is perhaps the best alternative design
	(with static variables and static methods)
	But now, the AbstractZoombinis3 class is
	not at all abstract!
