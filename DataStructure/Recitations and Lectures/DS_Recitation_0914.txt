class vehicle {
	void move(int x, int y){...}
}

class car extends vehicle{
	void move(int x, int y){...}
}

// in program
			vehicle v = new vehicle();
			v.move(100, 200);
			car c = new car();
			c.move(50,70);
			
			void f(vehicle q){
				q.move(20, 50);
			}
			
// if f(c)
	the method in car will override vehicle
	
// Subtype means q could be a vehicle or car
// Dynamic dispatch means that which move method is called determined by the dynamic type of q
